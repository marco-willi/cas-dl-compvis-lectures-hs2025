## Introduction

Image classification is a core task of Computer Vision. In image classification, an image is assigned to a predefined set of classes. In multi-class classification, there are â‰¥ 2 classes; in binary classification, there are 2 classes; and in multi-label classification, there are several sets of classes. @fig-classification-classification-illustration illustrates the problem in multi-class classification.

## Parametric Approach

In a parametric approach, we seek a model of the following form:

$$
\hat{y}^{(i)} = f(\theta, \vect{x}^{(i)})
$$

We want to find model parameters $\theta$ that output a score/prediction $\hat{y}^{(i)}$ for any data points $\vect{x}^{(i)}$ for each class $k \in K$. We then want to assess how good this score is with the help of a loss function.

### Softmax Classifier

With a Softmax Classifier, we interpret model predictions/scores as probabilities of class memberships: $P(Y=\vect{y}^{(i)}| X = \vect{x}^{(i)})$. We interpret the output as a [Categorical Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution) over all possible classes.

To obtain a valid probability distribution, the untransformed outputs $\vect{z}$, also called logits, of a model are transformed with the softmax function $\sigma(\vect{z})$:

$$
P(Y = k| X = \vect{x}^{(i)}) = \sigma(\vect{z})_k = \frac{e^{z_k}}{\sum_i^K e^{z_i}}
$$

@fig-classification-logits-to-probs shows an example of the effect of the softmax transformation.

## Loss Function

Now we look at how to define the loss function $L(\m{X}, \vect{y}, \theta)$ for a multi-class classification problem.

### Likelihood

The likelihood of a data point $(\vect{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ is the probability of observing/realizing a data point, given a model with certain parameters:

$$
P(Y=y^{(i)}| X = \vect{x}^{(i)}) = f(\theta, \vect{x}^{(i)})
$$

This means we formulate a model with a probabilistic interpretation of predictions: $f(\theta, \vect{x}^{(i)}): \mathbb{R}^{n} \mapsto [0, 1]$

For a multi-class classification, the label vector is one-hot encoded $\vect{y}^{(i)} \in \{0, 1\}^K$, where the true class is coded with 1 and the rest with 0. The likelihood of a data point is defined as:

$$
\prod_{j=1}^K  P(Y = j| X = \vect{x}^{(i)})^{y^{(i)}_j}
$$

Since only one entry in $\vect{y}^{(i)}$ is 1, the likelihood is simply the prediction for the true class $P(Y = y^{(i)}| X = \vect{x}^{(i)})$.

)

y_pred = np.array(
    [0.1, 0.8, 0.2, 0.7, 0.9]
)

# Perfect Prediction
#y_pred = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 1])

# Larger Dataset
#y_true = np.repeat(y_true, 10, axis=0)
#y_pred = np.repeat(y_pred, 10, axis=0)


def calculate_likelihood(y_true: float, y_pred: float) -> float:
    return (y_pred ** y_true) * ((1 - y_pred) ** (1 - y_true))

def display_likelihood(y_true, y_pred):
    sample_likelihoods = [calculate_likelihood(float(yt), float(yp)) for yt, yp in zip(y_true, y_pred)]
    likelihood = np.prod(sample_likelihoods)

```

y_pred = np.repeat(y_pred, 10, axis=0)

```
:::


### Maximum Likelihood

The likelihood $P(\vect{y} | \theta, \m{X})$ of observing our entire dataset $(\m{X}, \vect{y})$, given the parameters $\theta$ and assuming that the data points $(\vect{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ are independent and identically distributed, can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^K  P(Y = j| X = \vect{x}^{(i)})^{y^{(i)}_j}
\end{equation}

Under the Maximum Likelihood approach, we seek the parameters $\theta$ that maximize the likelihood of observing the dataset.

### Negative Log-Likelihood

With Maximum Likelihood, we aim to choose the parameters $\theta$ such that $p(\vect{y} | \theta, \m{X})$ is maximized. However, this function can be complex to handle, and we can use some mathematical tricks. We take the logarithm of the likelihood so that the product of probabilities becomes a sum. Since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, we can maximize its logarithm instead of the function $p(\vect{y} | \theta, \m{X})$. Finally, we take the negative of the function, allowing us to minimize it.

\begin{equation}
L(\m{X}, \vect{y}, \theta) = - \log \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^K P(Y = j| X = \vect{x}^{(i)})^{y^{(i)}_j} \\
L(\m{X}, \vect{y}, \theta) = -\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^K y^{(i)}_j \log  P(Y = j| X = \vect{x}^{(i)})
\end{equation}

### Cross-Entropy

The loss function, derived with Maximum Likelihood, can also be viewed through the lens of cross-entropy between two discrete probability functions. Specifically, we can calculate and minimize the cross-entropy between the true distribution $\vect{y}^{(i)}$ and the predicted $\vect{\hat{y}}^{(i)}$. Cross-entropy comes from information theory and measures how many bits/nats on average are needed to describe an event of a probability distribution $p(x)$ when using the approximation $q(x)$.

\begin{equation}
CE = - \sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log q(x) \\
CE = - \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^K y_j^{(i)} \log \hat{y}_j^{(i)}
\end{equation}

It is evident that cross-entropy is identical to the negative log-likelihood.

## Architectures

Architecture refers to the complete definition of an untrained (deep-learning) model, i.e., the sequence and configuration of layers. The following are some important architectures that have been successfully used for image classification.

### AlexNet

CNNs became extremely popular after winning the [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) Competition. @krizhevsky_imagenet_2012 implemented a CNN with multiple layers, known as the AlexNet architecture, as shown in @fig-classification-alexnet. ImageNet is a large, hierarchical image dataset @deng_imagenet_2009, which enabled efficient training of CNNs for the first time.

AlexNet consists of 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully-connected layers. The last layer is a 1000-way softmax output to model the classes in ImageNet.

The model was trained with two GPUs (GTX 580) with 3GB memory each. Since 3GB was insufficient to train the model, the architecture was split across the GPUs. Some layers were split between the GPUs, allowing a larger network to be trained.

@fig-classification-alexnet shows the detailed architecture, including kernel sizes, the number of filters per layer, activation map dimensions, and pooling layers. ReLU was used as the activation function. This representation is from the original paper and shows how the model was split across two GPUs.

#| eval: true
#| echo: true

import torch
import torchvision.models as models
import torchinfo

alexnet = models.alexnet()
x = torch.zeros(1, 3, 224, 224, dtype=torch.float, requires_grad=False)
yhat = alexnet(x)

print(torchinfo.summary(alexnet, input_size=(1, 3, 224, 224)))
```

### VGG

@simonyan_very_2015 won the ImageNet Challenge in 2014 with their VGG architecture. They showed that smaller 3x3 kernels work significantly better and that deeper networks with 16-19 layers can be trained. @fig-classification-vgg shows the architecture as presented in the original paper. @fig-classification-vgg-arch visualizes the architecture.

VGG introduced a popular design element: A layer has the same number of filters as the previous layer unless the activation map dimensions are halved, in which case the number of filters is doubled (see also @fig-classification-vgg-arch). This was done to maintain the time complexity of the layers. VGG does not use normalization layers.

### ResNet

@He2016 wondered whether CNNs could be improved simply by making them deeper, i.e., adding more layers. Their experiments showed that adding layers eventually stops being beneficial, and performance saturates and then rapidly degrades (see @fig-classification-resnet-motivation1). They noticed that the performance did not degrade due to overfitting (see @fig-classification-resnet-motivation2, which shows that training error is also poor), but because back-propagation becomes less effective and the weights do not optimize well. @He2016 hypothesized that deeper networks could not perform worse than shallower ones because the additional layers could simply pass on activations unchanged.

:::

They then hypothesized that passing on activations unchanged as a default behavior could avoid this problem. They introduced identity mappings. @fig-classification-residual-connection shows such a connection. These connections are also called residual connections because the network only needs to learn the change in activations from layer $i$ to layer $i+1$, the residue.

ResNet @He2016 (Graphic from @johnson_eecs_2019.)
:::

ResNet was otherwise inspired by VGG16. The convolutional layers consist of 3x3 kernels (except the first one), and the number of filters is doubled when the activation map dimensions are halved. ResNet uses convolutions with stride 2 for down-sampling and no max pooling. At the end, ResNet uses a global average pooling layer followed by a fully-connected layer with the number of classes. Variants of ResNet have 18, 34, 50, and over 100 layers. ResNet also uses batch normalization. @fig-classification-resnet-struk shows the architecture.

:::

ResNet is very popular and is still widely used today (there are now more modern variants). Recent studies of identity mappings (or more generally skip connections) have shown that the gradient surface of the loss function becomes smoother, allowing the network to be optimized better. This is impressively illustrated in @fig-classification-skip-loss-landscape.

### ConvNext

One of the most modern CNN architectures was described in @liu_convnet_2022. This architecture uses tricks and implementation ideas accumulated over decades from various architectures. @fig-classification-convnext shows, starting from a modern version of ResNet, what has been adjusted to define this state-of-the-art architecture. Examples include: larger kernels, different activation functions, layer normalization instead of batch normalization, and depthwise separable convolutions.

### Which Architecture?

Which architecture should be chosen for a specific problem? A common tip is: *Don't be a hero.*

One should rely on off-the-shelf architectures and not implement their own without a good reason.

Typically, ResNet-50 or ResNet-101 are good choices. However, there are also models that require significantly fewer parameters, such as Efficient Nets.

Important considerations are also the requirements regarding accuracy, performance (FLOPs), and model size (memory).

## Further Variations

There are countless other architectures and especially specific layers or layer blocks that can be used in various architectures. The following are Squeeze/Excite Networks and the important class of normalization layers, which are often used and can significantly improve models or accelerate the optimization process.

### Squeeze/Excite Networks

Squeeze-and-Excite Networks (SE-Networks) were introduced in 2019 @hu_squeeze-and-excitation_2019. These include so-called Squeeze and Excite blocks (SE blocks), which allow the scaling of activation maps of a layer. This scaling is learnable through a few additional parameters. In practice, significant performance gains have been observed. @fig-classification-se-networks shows an illustration.

::: {#fig-classification-se-networks}
![]({{< meta params.images_path >}}se_networks.png){width=800}

Source: @hu_squeeze-and-excitation_2019.
:::


These SE blocks can be easily applied to arbitrary activation maps. @fig-classification-se-networks shows an input feature map $\tensor{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{H' \times W' \times C'}$ that is transformed with $F_{tr}$ (e.g., with a convolutional layer). This results in the activation maps $\tensor{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times C}$.

The transformation $F_{sq}(\cdot)$ applies the squeeze operation, a global average pooling, to generate a description of each channel by aggregating spatial information of the activation map $\tensor{U}$. This results in a vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 1 \times C}$.

The excitation operation $F_{ex}(\cdot, W)$ uses a gating mechanism with parameters $W$, implemented with two fully-connected layers and activation functions. The result is $s \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 1 \times C}$, the channel weights. It is called gating because the weights range from $[0, 1]$ and thus control how much information of a channel flows through (gatekeeping).

Finally, $F_{scale}(\cdot)$ scales the activation maps $\tensor{U}$ with the channel weights.

The operation can be described as follows:

\begin{equation}
U = F_{tr}(X) \\
z = F_{sq}(U) = \text{GlobalAvgPool}(U) \\
s = F_{ex}(z, W) = \sigma(\mathbf{W}_2 g(\mathbf{W}_1 z)) \\
\hat{X} = F_{scale}(U, s) = U \odot s
\end{equation}

where $g()$ represents the ReLU function, and $\sigma$ represents the sigmoid function.

### Normalization Layers

Normalization layers normalize activation maps to improve parameter learning. There are many variations, as shown in @fig-classification-normalization. In modern architectures, normalization layers are typically used. Popular is, for example, layer normalization (see @ba_layer_2016). The general form of normalization is given in equation @eq-classification-normalization. The parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learned, while the means $E[x]$ and variances $\sigma^2[x]$ are estimated from the activations. Why normalization layers work and which ones to prefer are still subjects of research and are often empirically tested in practice (considered as hyper-parameters). It is believed that the cost function becomes smoother overall, allowing the network to train faster and better @santurkar_how_2019.

## Pre-Processing

Typically, images are pre-processed before being processed by the CNN. This is done to make the optimization process converge faster. Common steps include:

- Resizing/cropping to a fixed size, e.g., 224x224x3. This is necessary for the images to be processed in a batch (they must have the same dimensions).
- Scaling: Images are scaled from the interval [0, 255] to the interval [0, 1].
- Normalization: Normalization is often done along the color channels so that the mean value of the pixel values is 0.

In `torchvision`, the following pre-processing steps are used: [Link](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/transforms/_presets.py)

## Transfer Learning

Transfer Learning refers to the process of adapting a trained model for Task A to Task B. Adapting pre-trained models often leads to better results and also reduces the number of training iterations. Deep learning frameworks often provide easy access to such models (also known as Model Zoo). For example, from PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html.

#| echo: true
