# CLIP Demo

This model can calculate similarities between and among images and texts. It can be used for zero-shot (no labels) image classification.

# Visual Question Answering

Test a model that can answer questions given an image. The notebook contains a small model which can be run on cpu and a much larger model which ideally is run on GPU.
