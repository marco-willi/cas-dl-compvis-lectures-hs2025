## Motivation

_Deep Learning_ models have played a transformative role in _Computer Vision_ over the last decade, significantly enhancing and expanding the capabilities to process visual data.

The integration of deep learning in computer vision has massively improved the accuracy and efficiency of visual recognition, classification, and analysis. This has opened up new possibilities in applications such as automated driving, facial recognition, and medical image analysis. These models are now embedded in a wide variety of products and services.

Letâ€™s take a look at several applications of deep learning assisted computer vision applications.

### Applications

To monitor wildlife populations biologists might deploy camera traps to capture images from passing animals (see @fig-intro-kora-lynx). These images need to be analysed, for example, biologists need to know which species can be seen in each image. Deep learning can speed up that process significantly (@Images2018).

Recent advances in generative deep learning enable anyone to create photorealistic synthetic images (see @fig-intro-synthetic-images for examples). While these technologies have many positive applications (art, design, prototyping), they also raise concerns about misinformation and deepfakes, motivating research into synthetic media detection (@mathys_synthetic_2024-1).

Apple's photo library uses deep learning to automatically classify and search through your photos. The system can recognize scenes (beach, mountain), objects (dog, car), and even activities (birthday, wedding). Additionally, sophisticated safety systems scan for problematic content while preserving privacy through on-device processing (@fig-intro-apple-safety).

Deep learning can be used to identify objects, to find similar images (image search / retrieval), ro to find (near-)duplicates (perceptual hashing), see @fig-intro-google-lens (left). Increasingly, models can cross modalities and, for example, process visual data and produce textual outputs. An interesting example is image captioning or the detection and translation of text in images  (optical character recognition - OCR), see @fig-intro-google-lens (right).

Face recognition technology, such as Apple's Face ID (@fig-intro-face-id), has become ubiquitous in consumer devices. The system uses infrared depth sensing to create a 3D map of facial features, making it more secure than 2D image-based recognition and robust to different lighting conditions.

## Computer Vision Tasks


### Image Classification

In image classification, an image is assigned to a predefined set of classes. In multi-class classification, there are $\gt 2$ classes; in binary classification, there are exactly 2 classes; and in multi-label classification, there are multiple sets of classes. @fig-intro-image_clssifier shows an example of multi-class classification.

::: {#fig-intro-image_clssifier width=600}

Multi-Class Image Classification example: a model predicts the most likely class for an image along with confidence scores (@krizhevsky_imagenet_2012).
:::


### Object Detection

Object detection involves locating and recognizing multiple objects in an image. @fig-intro-yolo-example shows an example from the paper by @Redmon2016a. Each object is localized with a bounding box and assigned an object class with a confidence score.

::: {#fig-intro-yolo-example}

Object Detection example (from @Redmon2016a). Bounding boxes localize the objects, showing the predicted class and confidence for each detection.
:::

### Segmentation

In segmentation, individual pixels are assigned to specific objects (instance segmentation) or classes (semantic segmentation). @fig-mask-rcnn-object-segmentation-example shows an example of instance segmentation from the paper by @he_mask_2018, where individual objects are detected and precisely localized at the pixel level.

Semantic segmentation applied to aerial imagery of agricultural fields. Each pixel is classified into crop types, field boundaries, and other land categories.
:::


### Keypoint Detection

In keypoint detection, specific points (keypoints) on objectsâ€”typically human body jointsâ€”are localized. @fig-mask-rcnn-keypoint-detection-example shows an example of keypoint detection from the paper by @he_mask_2018, where individual people are detected and their joints localized. This can be used to transfer movements from a person to an avatar or to recognize human activities (action recognition).

### Image Generation

There are various applications where models transform input images into specific output images (image-to-image translation) or generate completely new images from scratch (unconditional generation). Below are example applications.


#### Image Manipulation

Interactive manipulation allows users to modify images by dragging points to reshape objects while maintaining realistic appearance.

#### Image Translation


@fig-intro-pix2pix-example shows an example of image generation from the paper by @image_to_image_isola2018, where images are generated conditioned on image inputs (translated). This can be used, for example, to convert a sketch of an object into a photorealistic depiction of it.

:::


#### Image Super Resolution

In the gaming industry, Deep Learning is used to upscale low-resolution images to high-resolution in real-time (image super resolution), as shown in @fig-intro-dssl. This enables higher frame rates while maintaining visual quality.

:::


#### Image Colorization

Image colorization can be learned with Deep Learning. This involves transforming a black-and-white image into an RGB image. @fig-intro-colorization-example shows an example.

:::


#### View Synthesis

In view synthesis, new camera viewpoints of a scene are generated from a model. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are models that can generate novel views from a set of input images taken from known viewpoints. @fig-intro-nerf shows training data (input images from different angles) and the synthesized novel views the model can generate.

:::



#### Unconditional Generation

In unconditional image generation, images are generated that resemble the training data distribution without specific input guidance. While you have no direct control over what specific image is generated, you can often manipulate latent variables to modify generated images or interpolate between samples. @fig-intro-stylegan3 shows photorealistic portraits generated by a model trained on human faces.

**Applications:**

1. **Analyzing camera trap images** - Identifying which animals appear in wildlife monitoring photos
2. **Apple's on-device image categorization and safety filters** - Classifying photos into categories or detecting inappropriate content
3. **Image search** - Finding visually similar images in a large database
4. **Finding tumors in medical images** - Precisely localizing and delineating abnormal tissue in CT or MRI scans
5. **Counting apples in an orchard** - Detecting and tallying individual fruits on trees

**Available Tasks:**

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Image Segmentation
- Image Retrieval/Embedding

<details>
<summary>Click for result</summary>

1. **Analyzing camera trap images** â†’ **Image Classification or Object Detection**
   - *Image Classification* if you only need to know which species are present (one or more labels per image)
   - *Object Detection* if you need to count individuals or localize where each animal appears in the frame
   - The choice depends on the specific analysis requirements

2. **Apple's on-device image categorization and safety filters** â†’ **Image Classification**
   - This involves assigning images to predefined categories (e.g., "food", "people", "landscape") or detecting inappropriate content
   - Multi-label classification is used when an image can belong to multiple categories

3. **Image search** â†’ **Tricky - Not directly a standard task**
   - This doesn't fit neatly into classification, detection, or segmentation
   - Closest to *Image Classification* conceptually, as it relies on learned image representations/embeddings
   - In practice, uses feature extraction (embedding) to compute similarity between images
   - Often leverages classification networks trained on large datasets, but applied for retrieval rather than classification

4. **Finding tumors in medical images** â†’ **Image Segmentation**
   - Requires pixel-level precision to delineate tumor boundaries
   - *Semantic Segmentation* if identifying tumor vs. non-tumor tissue
   - *Instance Segmentation* if distinguishing between multiple separate tumors

5. **Counting apples in an orchard** â†’ **Object Detection**
   - Need to localize and count individual apples
   - Each apple gets a bounding box, and counting is straightforward from detection results
   - Could also use instance segmentation for more precise boundaries, but detection is typically sufficient

## Challenges

We will now explore some challenges that must be overcome when analyzing images with machine learning models.

### Semantic Gap {#sec-intro-challenges-semantic-gap}

The semantic gap refers to the discrepancy between the low-level pixel information that can be directly extracted from an image and the high-level semantic interpretation understood by humans. In simpler terms: an image consists of millions of pixel values, but deriving semantically meaningful concepts like "cat" or "sitting" from these raw numbers is extremely challenging.

::: {#fig-cat-number-grid}

![]({{< meta params.images_path >}}semantic_gap_comparison.png){width=600}

Illustration of the semantic gap: computers see numbers, humans see meaning.
:::

### Viewpoint

The semantic meaning of an image remains constant regardless of camera viewpoint, but the pixel values change dramatically. A model must learn to recognize the same object from different angles.

::: {#fig-intro-challenge-viewpoint}

![]({{< meta params.images_path >}}viewpoint_challenge.png){width=600}

The same cat from different viewpoints looks completely different at the pixel level.
:::

### Deformation

Objects, especially living beings, are often flexible and can appear in vastly different shapes and poses. Models must recognize a cat whether it's curled up sleeping or stretched out running.

::: {#fig-challenge-deformation}

Cats exhibit significant shape variation due to pose changes. [Source](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
:::

### Illumination

Changes in lighting conditions dramatically affect pixel values and can obscure object features. The same object under different lighting can produce vastly different images.

### Background Clutter

Background pixels can visually resemble the object of interest, making precise object localization and segmentation difficult. The model must learn to distinguish foreground from background.

### Occlusion

Objects are often partially hidden by other objects in the scene. Models must learn to recognize objects even when only part of them is visible.

::: {#fig-challenge-occlusion}

### Intra-Class Variation

Objects belonging to the same class can exhibit enormous variability in appearance, color, size, and texture. All cats are cats, but they can look very different from each other.

@fig-tiger-context shows that contextual information can be crucial for correct object classification. The surrounding scene provides important cues about what objects are likely to be present.

## Machine Learning


### Machine Learning Basics

::: {.callout-note title="ðŸ“š Quick ML Refresher"}

This course uses machine learning concepts throughout. If you need a detailed refresher on ML fundamentals, see our [Machine Learning Basics](../background/machine_learning.qmd) background page.

**Quick summary**: We follow a data-driven approach:

1. **Collect** a dataset of images and labels
2. **Train** a model that learns to map images to labels
3. **Evaluate** the model on new data

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

def train(images, labels):
 """ Train a Model """
 # Fit Model here
 return model

def predict(test_images, model):
 """ Predict """
 predictions = model(test_images)
 return predictions
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Model**: Function $f_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}) = \hat{y}$ with learnable parameters $\theta$
- **Optimization**: Find $\theta$ that minimizes loss $J(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{X}), \mathbf{y})$
- **Model Selection**: Use train/validation/test splits to avoid overfitting

:::

### ML with Classical Computer Vision

Images typically have very high dimensionality. For example, an RGB image with a resolution of $800 \times 600$ has a dimensionality of $800 \times 600 \times 3 = 1,440,000$. Classical machine learning algorithms often struggle with such high dimensionalities:

- They are very slow or require a lot of memory.
- They cannot exploit the 2-D structure of images.
- They are very sensitive to slight changes in images (e.g., rotations).
- They can easily overfit, as the number of features is close to the number of observations (training set).

When modeling images with (classical) machine learning algorithms, methods from (classical) computer vision are often used. With the help of such methods, features can be extracted from images, and the algorithms can learn on these features. This avoids modeling high-dimensional raw data. @fig-intro-color-histograms, @fig-intro-hog-features, and @fig-intro-bow-features show various feature extraction methods.

@fig-intro-color-histograms shows that, for example, the distribution over the color spectrum can be extracted from an image. This could be an important feature.

## Deep Learning

To accelerate research in computer vision and make progress more measurable, the PASCAL VOC Challenges were introduced @everingham_pascal_2007. These involved various tasks, such as detecting objects in photographs (@fig-intro-pascal).

The easy availability of images on the internet has made it possible to collect increasingly larger datasets. [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) is such a very large, hierarchically annotated image dataset @deng_imagenet_2009 with over 1.4 million images, categorized into 1,000 object classes. @fig-intro-imagenet illustrates the dataset.

#### The ImageNet Breakthrough (2012)

The year 2012 marked a watershed moment in computer vision. Until then, the state-of-the-art in the ImageNet competition relied on classical approaches. In 2011, the winning team @perronnin_large-scale_2010 combined various hand-crafted feature extraction methods (SIFT features) with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), achieving a top-5 error rate of 25.8%.

Then came the breakthrough: Krizhevsky et al. @krizhevsky_imagenet_2012 implemented **AlexNet**, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple layers, and achieved a top-5 error rate of just 16.4%â€”a dramatic 9.4 percentage point improvement. This wasn't just an incremental gain; it fundamentally demonstrated that deep learning could outperform decades of hand-crafted computer vision methods.

AlexNet architecture @krizhevsky_imagenet_2012: 5 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully connected layers, trained on dual GPUs.
:::

**What made AlexNet work?**

- **Deep architecture**: 8 layers (5 convolutional + 3 fully connected)
- **GPU training**: Used dual GPUs to handle 60 million parameters
- **ReLU activations**: Faster training than traditional sigmoid/tanh
- **Dropout regularization**: Reduced overfitting

This success marked the end of classical computer vision methods in many areas and triggered an explosion of deep learning research.

While classical computer vision trains a machine learning model on features extracted with hand-crafted algorithms @fig-intro-classical-ml, the development is increasingly moving towards end-to-end learning. In this approach, one avoids as much as possible static/hand-designed components and learns everything, including feature extraction, with machine learning @fig-intro-end-to-end.

Deep learning-based approaches have several key advantages over classical machine learning methods:

- **Automatic feature extraction**: No need for hand-crafted features like SIFT or HOG.
- **Hierarchical representations**: Learn features at multiple levels of abstraction (edges â†’ textures â†’ parts â†’ objects).
- **Better scaling**: Performance improves with more training data and compute.
- **End-to-end learning**: Unified optimization from raw inputs to task outputs.
- **Built-in invariances**: Architectures like CNNs are naturally invariant to certain transformations (e.g., translation).
- **Transfer learning**: Pre-trained models can be adapted to new tasks with limited data.

### Deep Learning History

We will now explore the most important milestones in deep learning for image analysis.

#### Hubel and Wiesel

@hubel_receptive_1959 showed in experiments on cats that there are complex cells/neurons in the visual cortex that only respond to certain patterns. In addition to these complex cells, there are also simple cells that only respond to lines at a certain angle.

#### Neocognitron

@fukushima_neocognitron_1980 defined a model of a neural network that can recognize visual patterns. It already has the hierarchical structure of a modern convolutional neural network and is inspired by biological neural networks, particularly from the insights of @hubel_receptive_1959.

#### Backpropagation

@rumelhart_learning_1986 introduced the backpropagation algorithm in the context of neural networks. This algorithm is used to train modern neural networks: it finds the parameters of an artificial neural network (ANN) to solve a specific task. Backpropagation is based on the chain rule from calculus and is also important for other machine learning models.

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

@lecun_gradient-based_1998 implemented convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize handwritten digits. The architecture is specialized for the 2-D structure of image data and trained a model very similar to modern CNNs, as shown in @fig-lecun-cnn.

:::

After AlexNet's breakthrough in 2012 (see previous section), CNNs rapidly evolved and were applied to increasingly complex tasks. Notable developments include:

- **VGGNet (2014)**: Showed that depth mattersâ€”16-19 layers with small 3Ã—3 filters
- **ResNet (2015)**: Introduced skip connections, enabling networks with 50-152 layers
- **COCO Challenges**: Expanded beyond ImageNet to multi-task benchmarks (detection, segmentation, keypoints)
- **Mobile architectures**: Efficient CNNs for deployment on phones and embedded devices

#### Other Architectures in Computer Vision

CNNs are still in use today (2025). Meanwhile, there are alternative architectures, such as transformer-based models (@dosovitskiy_image_2020), which are extremely successful in language modeling, or multilayer perceptron-based architectures (@liu_pay_2021).

The question of which architecture type will prevail is open. Currently, it seems that both CNNs and transformer-based models have their place, and often perform similarly (@smith_convnets_2023). Furthermore, hybrid-architectures, combining the strengths of CNNs and transformers have been proposed @vasu_fastvit_2023. Some works use both architecture types, depending on whether parameter efficiency (CNNs) or raw performance (transformers) are prioritized @simeoni_dinov3_2025.
